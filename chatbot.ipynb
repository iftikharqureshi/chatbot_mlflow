    "## Setting Up the Core Libraries for the Chatbot and Tracking System\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, I start by setting up the essential tools that make the rest of the notebook come alive. The idea is to build a small interactive chatbot that talks through an OpenAI model like GPT-3.5-Turbo while quietly keeping track of everything happening in the background using MLflow. To make that possible, I import a few important libraries. The `os` and `time` modules help manage system operations and measure timing details. `mlflow` is what I use to log and track all the key metrics from each chat session, such as response time, tokens used, and model parameters. The `openai` package provides direct access to the language model itself, while `tiktoken` helps count tokens so I can understand how much text is being processed. Finally, I bring in `colorama` to add a touch of color to the console output, making the chatbot responses more readable and visually engaging. Together, these imports form the foundation for an AI-powered chat experience that’s both interactive and measurable."

    "Here, I define all the key settings that control how the chatbot behaves and how MLflow connects to the tracking server. The first line pulls my OpenAI API key from an environment variable, which keeps it secure instead of hardcoding it directly in the notebook. Next, I set the model name to `gpt-3.5-turbo`, which will handle all the chat responses. The `MLFLOW_URI` points to my local MLflow server where the tracking data will be stored and viewed later. Then I configure several tuning parameters such as `TEMPERATURE`, `TOP_P`, `FREQUENCY_PENALTY`, and `PRESENCE_PENALTY`, which influence how creative or consistent the model’s responses are. The `MAX_TOKENS` value limits how long the responses can be, while `DEBUG` lets me toggle extra logging for troubleshooting if needed. Together, these constants define the chatbot’s behavior and ensure the system logs each conversation under the right experiment setup."

The function then sends the full conversation history to the model using the `ChatCompletion` API, along with the configured parameters that shape the tone and creativity of the response. Once the model replies, I measure the total latency and extract the AI’s message. To keep track of efficiency, I count tokens for the latest user input, the entire conversation, and the model’s response. These metrics, along with the model configuration details, are logged to MLflow so I can analyze patterns like response time or token usage over different runs. If debugging is enabled, I can even pause to inspect the active run ID before continuing. In the end, the function returns the AI-generated text, completing one full cycle of interaction, measurement, and tracking."

    "When I asked the question, \"Explain how machine learning differs from traditional programming,\" the model delivered a clear and accurate explanation that effectively contrasted rule-based programming with data-driven learning. The model’s response clearly demonstrates that both the chatbot and MLflow tracking are functioning as intended. It provides an accurate and well-organized explanation that distinguishes traditional programming from machine learning in a simple, logical way. The tone is clear and instructive, showing that the model can communicate technical ideas effectively. The successful logging of metrics, visible run details, and smooth display formatting confirm that the full interaction pipeline—from user input to AI response and experiment tracking—works seamlessly, making this an effective first validation of the system."
